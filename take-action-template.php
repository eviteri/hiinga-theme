                    While investments and donations allow Hiinga to serve thousands of individuals through
                    entrepreneurial endeavors, there are many ways you can get involved and support our 
                    mission. We've learned from experience that when people think outside the box, there's
                    no limit to what they can do for others!

                                that the African marketplace is a mission field, ripe for harvest. They invest their talents; skills and capital so as to 
                                be transformational in creating thriving and dignified communities, through redemptive entrepreneurship. Our Impact Investors
