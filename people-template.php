                                    His ventures employ about 35 people; yet despite his business acumen and success record,
                                    access to
                                    capital has been difficult to secure. Alfred launched his first business after leaving
                                    9th grade.
                                    His community was in war and his parents were unable to sustain his school tuition in a
                                    peaceful
                                    part of the country. With just $5, he started trading produce and, eventually, selling
                                    water to the
                                    military base. When peace returned to Gulu, he realized he had a business model for the
                                    future.
                                    Hiinga provides both capital and leadership development to help Alfred expand his
                                    business beyond
                                    the Northern Region.

                                    With barely enough to feed her family, selling surplus was not an option. In 2014,
                                    Gertrude was introduced to an all women credit and savings cooperative which met weekly
                                    for prayer, fellowship, and opportunities to save money and learn modern agricultural
                                    methods. As the group grew in savings, work ethic and solidarity, it was able to qualify
                                    for a Hiinga partnership. With our investment, Gertrude expanded her farming enterprise
                                    to 14 acres of coffee, soy beans and corn. During peak harvests, she provides jobs for
                                    up to 30 people in her village.

                                    families. Peter says, “University never taught me how to run a business, but Hiinga is
                                    giving me these skills that I find extremely valuable.” Currently, Pena Ebenezer employs
                                    25 people including teachers and support staff, and Hiinga is helping Peter create 25
